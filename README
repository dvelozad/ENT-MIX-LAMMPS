This is a fork of LAMMPS, a molecular dynamics simulator.

The idea behind this fork is to implement the entropic demixing model for the calculation of entropic forces in LAMMPS.

The details of the entropic demixing model can be found in the following paper:
https://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jpcb.0c07575


To compile clone the repository using the command:
```git clone https://github.com/dvelozad/ENT-MIX-LAMMPS.git```

Then, go to the `ENT-MIX-LAMMPS/src` directory and run:
```make mpi -j8```

The files to edit to add the entropic demixing model are:
- `pair_ent_demix.h`
- `pair_ent_demix.cpp`
- `fix_ent_demix.h`
- `fix_ent_demix.cpp`

Remember that pair refers to the pair style in LAMMPS, which is used to calculate the interactions between pairs of atoms, while fix refers to the fix style, which is used to apply constraints or modifications to the simulation.

In the Fix we will calculte the coordination numbers and their derivatives (if needed), which are then used in the pair style to calculate the entropic forces.

I left an initial structure for coordination number calculation in the `fix_ent_demix.cpp` file, but it is not yet implemented. You can use the `atom->N` array to store the coordination numbers and if needed we can then define `atom->N_d` for their derivatives.

The entropic demixing model is implemented in the `pair_ent_demix` class, which inherits from the `Pair` class in LAMMPS. The key method to implement is the compute method, which calculates the forces and energies based on the entropic demixing model.

We will need to modify the setting, coeff and compute methods in the `pair_ent_demix` class to handle the entropic forces and energies. This part requieres the understanding of the entropic demixing model and what parameters are needed for the calculation.
